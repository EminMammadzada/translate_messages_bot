# translate_messages_bot
Telegram bot designed to overcome language barriers and improve communication



### PROJECT INSPIRATION

This project was inspired by a communication issue we had in our telegram group chat: me and my other friend
would often start unconsciously chatting in russian and that would leave our third friend out of conversation.
To make our group chat more inclusive, I thought of creating this bot so it translates from 4 languages that
might be part of our conversation: Italian, French, English, and Russian.


### DETAILS

This bot was created in Python using pyTelegramBotAPI. I used free tier of Microsoft Translator to create the "heart" 
of the program. I ran into certain issues with setting webhooks when deploying the project online, so at the moment 
it is constantly getting updates from telegram servers. In future versions this issue will be fixed for a more 
efficient way of communicating with telegram servers.
